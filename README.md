# Localisation Project
## Overview

This repository contains code for performing localization tasks using LiDAR and marker data. The project focuses on reading, processing, and visualizing LiDAR scans and marker locations to compute transformations and analyze phone positions.


## Structure

    lidar/: Contains scripts for processing LiDAR data.
    markers_location/: Scripts for handling base stations locations and orientations.
    phone_locations/: Scripts for analyzing phone locations and orientations using the base station coordinates.
    
## Requirements

    MATLAB 2024a or above
